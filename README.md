***Hello my friendÔºÅ*** 

Here are my code study notes on the HCI topic, which is a related project I have done myself. 

My personal favorite areas of HCI include
1. ***Interaction and Human Behavior Modeling***
2. ***AI-assisted Design***
3. ***Interactive 3D Graphics***

Although I'm still at a relatively beginner level and learning how to write better projects. 
If you are also ***very interested*** in HCI, especially ***AI for Modeling human behavior***, or have ***more suggestions*** for my project, please be sure to contact me and let us ***make progress together***.
