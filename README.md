***Hello my friendÔºÅ*** 

Here are my code study notes on the HCI topic, which is a related project I have done myself. 

Although I'm still at a relatively beginner level and learning how to write better projects. 
If you are also ***very interested*** in HCI, especially ***Spatial audio and speech synthesis***, or have ***more suggestions*** for my project, please be sure to contact me and let us ***make progress together***.
