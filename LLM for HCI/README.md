These projects are for Research in AI assisted Design and Reading task.

**Project-1:**

This project is a prototype in ChatGPT-assisted academic papers reading assignment. I designed the workflow and test it with real users.

**Project-2:**

This project is mainly about LLM-assisted users' scenarios based design. It probably is about UI design. I have started working on it.
I will finish this project this semester(by May).
